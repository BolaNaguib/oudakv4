so first thing to do is 
 
// to add the changes u made to files
git add .  


//to add a message and commit the changes 
git commit -m " Your Message Here"

// to push to the rep 
// git push 

did u get it ?
yeah i just got it thanks

also a note we dont push the vendoes - etc to the repo cuz we can always do it using composer install 

this way i can see ur code after u finish and safely merge it
